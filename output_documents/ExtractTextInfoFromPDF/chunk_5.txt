 enhancement. Hudnall will shoulder the tasks of data access, curation, and KG development in the health domain, while Dolliver will handle similar tasks but with a focus on the justice aspect. Li, specializing in geoinformatics, will manage data access, curation, and KG development for this specific aspect. Representing the industry, Cox will be in charge of the project’s deliverables, which include the alpha, beta, and final deployment stages. Figure 12: Logic model to support the Evaluation Plan. 5. Evaluation Plan Our assessment approach consists of quarterly examinations conducted by our autonomous data governance board. This body will scrutinize the data, documentation, and project-generated artifacts. In addition, they will accumulate insights by conducting interviews with the PI and Co-PIs. The assessment consultants will deliver feedback regarding how well the project adheres to its initial plan. Depending on the needs of the project, consultants will also lend their proficiency in data governance research, providing guidance and recommendations based on their prior experience in resolving issues in comparable research projects. As illustrated in Figure 12, the logic model outlines the activities, output, outcomes, along with corresponding evaluation questions (EQ). • EQ1: (Year 1 and Year 2) Were the activities pertaining to Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) executed as per the plan? Did these activities yield adequate data or insights to inform the design of the knowledge graph, thus assisting the data-driven needs of end users’ decision-making processes? • EQ2: (Year 1) Were the planned design activities, such as workshops and meetings, carried out eﬀectively? What was the participation level of community practitioners and end users at these workshops? Were these design activities successful in generating adequate data or insights to facilitate the development of the knowledge graph for rural resilience? • EQ3: (Year 2) How closely did the data synthesis and quality assurance activities follow the planned schedule and were they executed as intended? How would one rate the quality of the knowledge graph in terms of its precision in assessing data quality, schema coherence, and mapping consistency? How eﬀective was the knowledge graph in validating its reasoning against the KG entities as provided by experts, end users, and/or other KG projects? • EQ4: (Year 2 and Year 3) Did the pilot implementation with beta-level deliverables proceed as anticipated? What was the count of trainings, end users, and practitioners involved in the pilot projects? How engaged were the users as measured by the duration spent interacting with the knowledge graphs and the distinct activities undertaken in relation to the beta-level deliverables? What feedback and recommendations for enhancement did users provide, as gathered from surveys and interviews? Upon receiving the grant award notification, the data governance board will collaborate with the PI and CoPIs to fine-tune the evaluation queries, finalize the specific tasks required for evaluation, and review the schedule for the evaluation. The PI and CoPIs will assist in the evaluation process by periodically supplying the necessary research documentation or summaries, along with data derived from all research activities and pilot studies, including design documents, pilot study designs, student outcomes, and activity log data. In the project’s concluding year, the evaluation consultants will compile a comprehensive summative evaluation. This document will record the degree to which the research project accomplished its objectives, address any unintended outcomes, and will include recommendations for enhancing future projects. 6. Scalability, Extensibility, And Sustainability Plan AI for Rural Resilience This project represents one of the pioneering initiatives emerging from the currently under-construction AI research and education center at the University of Alabama. One of the primary goals of this center is to devise bespoke AI solutions, encompassing tools, systems, and packages that are specifically designed to cater to the needs of communities with low socio-economic status, a common occurrence in Alabama. The purpose is to acknowledge and address the unique challenges and necessities of these communities, equipping them with AI technology that has the potential to uplift their living conditions. The United Health Foundation (UHF) reports that numerous Southern States—including Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, Tennessee, Arkansas, and Oklahoma—repeatedly score low in the U.S. for economic status, education, and health and wellness indicators. To address this, the project’s scalability will augment the proposed knowledge graph system’s ability to manage an escalating volume of data and user interactions across all these Southern U.S. states. Sustainability Operational sustainability will be linked to the AI center that’s currently under development, sharing staﬀ resources and operational roles with this project. This collaboration ensures the long-term maintenance of the knowledge graph system, its cost-eﬃciency, and the provision of adequate staﬃng to keep the system running optimally. On the other hand, the task of keeping the knowledge graph data current and relevant will be bolstered by other projects, notably the use cases. Promoting rural resilience to public health and environmental crises—such as vaccine hesitancy, the opioid crisis, drought, and ﬂoods—is a vital research and community engagement focus supported by various funding agencies, including NOAA, USGS, and NIH. Signiﬁcantly, the National Water Center resides on the University of Alabama campus, and the Cooperative Institute for Research to Operations in Hydrology (CIROH), a national consortium formed in partnership between NOAA and The University of Alabama, is dedicated to improving water prediction (including streamﬂow forecasts, extreme events like ﬂoods and droughts, and water quality) and enhancing community resilience to water-related challenges. 7. Data/AI Ethics Standards And Guidance Our team, targeting government-related constituents like ADPH with the proposed OKN, will follow the principles from Executive Order 13960 for developing trustworthy AI. This commitment involves implementing CBPR, transfer learning, and fine-tuning LLMs. We will hold roundtable discussions under the guidance of the University administration and ethical workforce to uphold national values and legality. We will establish risk-benefit analysis methods for AI project phases and work with the University’s Cybersecurity and Social work teams to address security concerns. Our development process will prioritize transparency, ensuring understanding among experts and users. Our commitment extends to ensuring the proposed OKN project aligns with these principles and is utilized in a way that suits the intended purposes of each Knowledge Graph (KG) application, especially in promoting rural resilience. We will ensure that KG design, development, acquisition, usage, and relevant inputs and outputs from specific KG applications are thoroughly documented and traceable to the best of our ability. These principles are consistent across various OKN projects and themes. Our team is actively interested in contributing to initiatives to alleviate ethical concerns and develop standards and guidelines. However, our project focusing on rural resilience confronts a unique and substantial issue -the Digital Divide [69–71]. Our team, through previous work, has explored several approaches to address this crucial challenge. Digital Divide Our team brings to the table a wealth of experience in partnering with local communities, and we possess a profound understanding of the potential challenges that may arise alongside the advantages conferred by advanced digital technologies, especially in rural areas characterized by lower socioeconomic status. In these regions, a substantial digital divide exists, largely due to the unavailability and inaccessibility of aﬀordable broadband internet [72, 73]. Today’s digital health solutions typically presuppose user access to broadband internet, but the reality sig-niﬁcantly diverges from these assumptions. In states like Alabama and Mississippi, nearly half of the rural inhabitants lack access to such services, underlining a stark disconnect between expectation and actuality [72, 73]. Given these circumstances, our project will be grounded in community-based participatory research activities. During our pilot study, we leveraged remote sensing data to identify all residents in Alabama State and collaborated with local community health and social workers to reach out to rural residents via postal mails. This strategy ensured the engagement of those aﬀected by the digital divide, in line with our commitment to ”Leave No One Behind”. These postal engagement of the community members will not only solve the digital divide issue, but also reduce the over-reliance on technology, which might overlook the importance of human judgment and local knowledge in health and justice matters. 8. Broader Impacts A comprehensive and accessible knowledge graph will act as a navigational tool, enabling eﬀective resource allocation, policy development, and partnership establishment within rural communities. It will notably empower underrepresented groups, providing them a platform to assert their perspectives and inﬂuence decisions of substantial signiﬁcance. To ensure the widespread dissemination of the knowledge products derived from this project, our outreach initiatives will target a diverse group of stakeholders, including interdisciplinary researchers, educators, students, school administrators, and industry partners across multiple practice domains. This project will generate a robust collection of learning science methodologies, computational models, design frameworks, software artifacts, and empirical data, thus providing a rich resource for the interdisciplinary educational research community to further advance teaching and learning in knowledge graphs.
