Proto-OKN Theme 1: Creating A Cross-Domain Knowledge Graph To Integrate Health And Justice For Rural Resilience Overview Enhancing the resilience of our nation’s rural communities to existing and upcoming crises is of pressing importance, as these areas are vital for preserving essential resources such as air quality, water supplies, food production, and supply chains -a realization underscored by the CoVID-19 pandemic. Following our preliminary work, we have pinpointed collaborators and mapped out the capabilities required for rural resilience, particularly in the context of public health and environmental crises. Central to these requirements of resources and community collaborations is the ability to collect and analyze data related to health outcomes and climate changes, along with social determinants of health and justice within rural locales. Therefore, we have put together a specialized team that’s dedicated to overcoming diﬃculties in data gathering and analysis. The method involves the construction of an extensive, interdisciplinary knowledge graph. This graph is designed to merge, portray, and interconnect previously separate health and justice data sets. It’s a powerful resource designed to aid researchers, practitioners, and educators in improving their understanding of risk environments in rural locations and strengthening their resilience. The project’s goal is to make use of existing geo-enrichment services and initiatives like the NSF-funded KnowWhereGraph. The team is devoted to synchronizing our eﬀorts with these programs, as well as other Proto-OKN themes, in order to enhance our scientiﬁc studies of rural resilience to public health and environmental crises. Intellectual Merit We envision this research will advance our knowledge in computer & Information science and social & behavioral science. Contributions to Computer Science: (1) Creating a multidisciplinary knowledge graph to integrate diverse datasets with consideration of human, social, and organizational factors signifies a progressive and innovative approach to data management and analysis. and (2) advancing data amalgamation methods to address inherent challenges in data management, such as heterogeneity, sparsity, and privacy, through the implementation of transfer and generative learning mechanisms across a variety of datasets, with an emphasis on social and cultural context. Contributions to Social Science: (1) Establishing a novel approach to Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) that forms the foundation of our project, paving the way toward impactful and sustainable outcomes. (2) Forging a deeply integrated workflow that synergizes CBPR with developing the knowledge graph to actively engage domain knowledge experts and a broad spectrum of constituents. Broader Impacts A comprehensive and accessible knowledge graph will act as a navigational tool, enabling eﬀective resource allocation, policy development, and partnership establishment within rural communities. It will notably empower underrepresented groups, providing them a platform to assert their perspectives and inﬂuence decisions of substantial signiﬁcance. To ensure the widespread dissemination of the knowledge products derived from this project, our outreach initiatives will target a diverse group of stakeholders, including interdisciplinary researchers, educators, students, school administrators, and industry partners across multiple practice domains. This project will generate a robust collection of learning science methodologies, computational models, design frameworks, software artifacts, and empirical data, thus providing a rich resource for the interdisciplinary educational research community to further advance teaching and learning in knowledge graphs.

Integrative Sociotechnical Research And Development 1.1 Significance Of An Integrated, Community-Centered Approach Our nation’s rural communities, central to preserving vital resources like air quality, water supplies, food production, and supply chain, often bear the brunt of public health and environmental crises [1–4]. The recent pandemic crisis underscored the need to proactively address pressing concerns through initiatives that leverage extensive data generated across all life aspects, thereby strengthening these communities’ resilience to ongoing and future crises [5–7]. Simultaneously, it is crucial to recognize that health and justice are pivotal for fostering resilience in rural areas, particularly in communities with the lowest socioeconomic status [8, 9]. These communities, often marred by high poverty and uninsured rates, limited education, and healthcare access, are critically underrepresented in data and related workflow [8, 10, 11]. This under-representation manifests as challenges in data availability, quality, standardization, integration, limited sample size, privacy, confidentiality, and bias [12–15]. Hence, a novel approach, such as open knowledge graph [16], would be necessary that amalgamates diverse datasets, providing analysts with comprehensive contextual information. This methodology, paired with technology enabling densely integrated, cross-domain data, can cultivate reliable, mutually beneficial, and cooperative partnerships to boost the resilience of rural areas to both present and forthcoming public health and environmental crises [17, 18]. This perspective has prompted the NSF to advocate for ”harnessing the vast amounts of data generated in every sphere of life and transforming them into useful, actionable information and knowledge”. This project is geared towards addressing these challenges by creating a comprehensive, cross-domain knowledge graph. This graph will combine, represent, and interconnect formerly separated health and justice datasets, providing a powerful tool to support researchers, practitioners, and educators in their eﬀorts to deepen their understanding of risk environments in rural regions and fortify their resilience. The project plans to harness existing geo-enrichment services and agencies like the NSF-funded KnowWhereGraph [19] and the Resilient Rural America Project for Extreme Weather [20]. It intends to align with these programs and other research-related themes to augment our scientiﬁc endeavors. Additionally, the project aims to broaden its dataset collection by incor-Figure 1: Conceptual representation of the proposed integrated, community-centered approach. porating the CDC’s Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) and PLACES data, electronic health records (EHR) from Medicare and Medicaid, data from the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities’ Science Collaborative for Health Disparities and Artificial Intelligence Bias Reduction (ScHARe), along with justice datasets from the Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR). As depicted in Figure 1, the data science workflow commences with a preparatory phase, which encompasses data preprocessing, self-evaluation, team formation, and community interaction. This stage constitutes a pivotal step for human-centered design methods, known as community-based participatory research [21], that lie at the heart of this project and encourages the involvement of local community partners and end users. Following the formation of the team and community engagement, the subsequent stage involves data quality evaluation concerning aspects like sparsity, availability, cost-eﬀectiveness, standardization, limited sample size, privacy, conﬁdentiality, and bias. Drawn from our empirical observations and preliminary work [22], a majority of the existing datasets tend to be sparse for rural areas, and there are data gaps due to various reasons, such as aﬀordability [12–15]. Consequently, the ensuing step is to employ transfer learning and generative techniques to create synthetic data, thereby enhancing data quality while ensuring privacy [23, 24]. Upon augmenting the data, we will formulate an ontology related to public health and environmental crises to generate sub-graphs that bolster the integrated level of the knowledge graph. Primarily, the anticipated knowledge graph will be employed to depict the health and justice aspects of determinants, as illustrated in Figure 2. At the concluding stage, multi-scale data synthesis models, such as behavioral agents, will be developed, utilizing the knowledge graph and the generative techniques, to comply with the guidelines of the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD) Minority Health and Health Disparities Research Framework [25], which is increasingly being embraced by numerous end users.
