It also highlights the endeavor to enhance transparency. During the data preparation phase, we will employ standardized data formats [32, 33], ensuring that data can be eﬀortlessly accessed, comprehended, and utilized by all system users. We will also put into action a data governance plan [34] to safeguard data availability, usability, integrity, and security, while also conﬁrming the data’s accessibility to all pertinent stakeholders. Further, we will maintain a detailed record of data lineage [35], tracing its origin, destinations, and alterations throughout its lifecycle. In the knowledge graph development phase, we will create open-source software, leveraging sharing platforms such as GitHub and The Open Science Framework [36]. We will also provide APIs to allow seamless data integration from external systems. Whenever updates or modiﬁcations occur within the system, we will disseminate clear and comprehensive release notes detailing what has been altered, the reasons behind the changes, and how these changes aﬀect the users. Finally, the CBPR will aid in reﬁning the system interface to ensure user-friendliness, compliance with ethical standards, and adherence to regulatory norms. Regular online workshops will also be conducted to carry out system audits, the reports of which will be shared with users and stakeholders. 1.3 Technological Dimensions Use Cases and Capability Requirments. Our team has collaborated closely with end users, comprising entities like the National Association of Social Workers, the Department of Public Health, Emergency Medical Services, the Opioid Overdose and Addiction Council, and the Department of Veterans Aﬀairs. We have partnered with them to pinpoint speciﬁc scenarios that can enhance rural resilience, particularly in relation to public health and environmental crises. The focus areas within public health crises have been mental health emergencies [37], substance abuse issues [38], disease pandemics [39], and epidemics, as well as challenges in vaccine uptake [40]. In the context of environmental crises, we’ve concentrated on climate change [41], drought conditions, and ﬂood events [42]. After consolidating the capabilities required for each use case to bolster rural resilience in public health and environmental crises, we’ve categorized them into two primary groups [1, 4, 8]. The first category pertains to resources, while the second is associated with community engagement and education. To illustrate, in the context of public health crises, elements like healthcare infrastructure, medical personnel, telehealth facilities and internet capacity, emergency readiness, and mental health services fall under the resource-related category. This area requires consistent ﬁnan-cial backing for advancement. On the other hand, facets such as education and public awareness, community participation, and policy advocacy fall under the community engagement and education category. This area necessitates the forging of robust partnerships across various sectors, including health, justice, and social services, and at diﬀerent governmental tiers, as well as cooperation with non-proﬁt organizations, academic institutions, and the private sector. Underpinning these requirements of resources and community collaborations is the ability to gather and interpret data pertaining to health outcomes and climate alterations, accessibility to care and emergency services, as well as social determinants of health and justice within rural areas. This capability can serve as a compass, guiding the eﬀective and eﬃcient deployment of these resources, the shaping of policies, and the forging of partnerships [43, 44]. Although the ability to gather and analyze data is crucial, rural communities and their governance structures continuously grapple with obstacles and limitations [12–15]. Firstly, the current state of data collection in these communities is quite scant due to cost-related factors and aﬀordability issues. Secondly, the existing data silos are segregated across various domains and cultural perspectives, preventing a comprehensive view. Thirdly, there is a dearth of eﬃcient data governance plans and practices. Consequently, a majority of the data are managed centrally, leading to scalability issues and delays in updates when attempts are made to include more diverse data. Lastly, there are minimal eﬀorts to integrate this disparate data, which hampers the possibility of conducting detailed follow-up inquiries using the enriched data. Data Sources and Their Utility. Building resilient rural communities is deeply intertwined with public health and the principles of social, economic, and environmental justice. Rural re-Figure 5: A summary of the raw datasets and their providers, and an example of knowledge graph. silience, particularly in the face of public health and environmental crises, embodies the capacity of these communities to not only anticipate and prevent potential hazards but also to eﬀectively manage, respond to, and recover from various health and environmental disruptions [5–7]. The foundation of such resilience is built upon a range of health and justice-related pillars. These include the presence of a robust healthcare infrastructure, investment in public health education and training, eﬀective environmental management strategies, preparedness and resources for emergency situations, an ethos of participatory decision-making, and a steadfast commitment to health equity and access to justice [45, 46]. Therefore, the project aims to consolidate and integrate various public datasets that are relevant to the factors outlined, which are displayed in Figure 5, along with an illustrative example of a knowledge graph. • Health data on equity and mental health disparities, primarily provided by the CDC and NIMHD, will incorporate crucial insurance information from the Alabama Department of Public Health (ADPH). The ADPH, a critical end user of this data, will focus on addressing substantial public health issues like substance abuse [47], vaccine hesitancy [48, 49], and suicide [50], especially in Alabama’s underrepresented Black Belt communities. • Justice-related datasets will explore the intricate interplay between social and criminal justice, health equity, and mental health disparities. The chief provider of this data is the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR). The National Survey on Drug Use and Health will also be incorporated to reﬁne use case scenarios. Individuals entangled in the criminal justice system frequently encounter obstacles to healthcare access, and incarceration can lead to lasting adverse health eﬀects [51]. Furthermore, communities of color have been disproportionately aﬀected by policies associated with the War on Drugs, intensifying existing health disparities [52]. • Datasets related to environmental issues will scrutinize the eﬀects of environmental crises—ranging from climate change, pandemics, land utilization, and water scarcity—on health equity, as well as social and criminal justice. Climate change events, such as heatwaves, ﬂoods, and hurricanes, often impose a disproportionate burden on lower-income and ethnic minority communities, thereby magnifying pre-existing health inequalities. Other crises, like pandemics, have the potential to catalyze spikes in unemployment and crime rates, including intimate partner violence, serious assaults, and homicides, due to the disturbances they cause in social structures and services [53]. Data Representation and Quality Assurance. The aforementioned datasets, which explore the intricate intersections of health and justice within the framework of public health and environmental crises in rural communities, encapsulate an extensive and sophisticated array of knowledge encompassing diverse subjects, clusters of concerns, and their interconnections. During the creation of the proposed knowledge graph, the validation of the graph structures will likely play a vital role. Consequently, this project will leverage OWL to define the semantics of the data, as depicted in Figure 6. Additionally, we’ll employ SHACL to validate the data against specific shapes or constraints, supplementing the capabilities of OWL [54, 55]. The implementation of quality assurance for both schema and entity mappings will be carried out via a cycle of validation measures. These will encompass validation of the schema, verification Figure 6: Quality assurance process. of entity mapping, assessment of data quality, and execution of automated tests, in addition to a review from an interdisciplinary perspective. The iterative process of refinement is graphically presented in Figure 6. In a bid to guarantee open accessibility to both the employed methods and the derived results, comprehensive documentation of all these stages will be conducted, and this record will be made openly available to the public. Query within the NIMHD Research Framework. The query design for the proposed knowledge graph will adhere to the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities Research Framework [25], which encompasses two dimensions: levels of influence and domains of influence. The levels of influence span from individual persons to societal factors, while the domains of influ-ence include biological, behavioral, physical/built environment, sociocultural environment
