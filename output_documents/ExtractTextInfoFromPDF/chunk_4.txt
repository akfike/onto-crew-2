, fostering advanced research and development in AI. The AI Center is strategically positioned to act as a catalyst, further extending PI Gong’s ability to involve and interact with a diverse range of stakeholders and constituents. This platform will enable an increase in participation from government agencies, industry representatives, academia, non-proﬁts, and citizen groups, thereby fostering a truly collaborative approach. Moreover, the center will signiﬁcantly contribute to the real-world use cases that this project targets. With AI technology’s potential to solve complex problems and generate insights, the center is expected to enhance the eﬀectiveness and impact of the targeted use cases. Consultation and Collaboration Leveraging the resources of the in-development AI center, our project will commence with a kick-oﬀ meeting. This introductory gathering will serve to acquaint all stakeholders with one another, along with establishing a clear understanding of the project’s objectives and timeline. We will maintain regular weekly meetings as a platform for all participants to share progress updates, tackle challenges in a collaborative manner, brainstorm solutions, and make necessary adjustments to the project plan. In-depth exploration of key themes, such as the government’s decision-making process in relation to public health and justice, will be facilitated through round-table discussions and specialized consultation sessions. These forums aim to foster a deeper understanding and encourage open dialogue on pivotal aspects of the project. Moreover, to ensure that stakeholders have the opportunity to contribute their thoughts and feedback beyond the conﬁnes of formal meetings and workshops, we will introduce various feedback mechanisms. These will include options like surveys and suggestion boxes, encouraging a constant ﬂow of communication and promoting an inclusive, participatory environment. Data Integration and Validation In our endeavor, we will collaborate closely with data providers such as federal agencies (including CDC, NASA, NOAA), data repositories (like ICPSR), and regional agencies (including ADPH). Our collaboration will aim to facilitate the data science workflow, which encompasses activities like data inventory, data curation, schema mapping, entity resolution, data integration and quality assessment, and data reconciliation. It’s essential to acknowledge that the transfer and generative learning processes necessitate legal frameworks provided by government agencies. Additionally, they rely on the technical infrastructure and industry-speciﬁc insights oﬀered by our industry partners. Non-proﬁt organizations and citizen groups play a key role by providing access to ground-truth data and understanding of the local social and cultural context. They also help evaluate the practical applicability of the knowledge graph in real-world scenarios. Governance and Oversight We will form a data governance board with diverse stakeholder representatives for oversight, identified via the Community-Based Participatory Research process. This board will establish policies and procedures for key areas like data management, privacy, security, and ethics, in compliance with regulations and best practices. The University’s Institutional Review Board will enforce these policies through regular compliance checks. We’ll also establish mechanisms for conflict resolution and consistently monitor project progress. Transparent reporting to the board and stakeholders on milestones, budget, compliance, and potential risks will keep all parties informed. Training and Capacity Building In the Alabama State context, training and capacity-building are vital for this project, fostering partnerships and community engagement. We’ll create accessible training resources like manuals, guides, and tutorials using knowledge graphs and other resulting knowledge and materials during the R&D processes. Regular training sessions will be conducted in diverse formats according to stakeholder preferences. We’ll also enhance the capabilities of entities like ADPH, NASW, and NAMI, aiding them to improve their data infrastructure and create their own training programs. This eﬀort will be reinforced by the AI center currently in development, aiming to empower participants and ensure successful project execution. 3. Collaboration Plan As shown in Figure 10, our project team understands the immense value of collaboration, particularly when working with large-scale knowledge graph systems. Therefore, we express our sincere eagerness to collaborate with existing initiatives that have demonstrated signiﬁcant strides in related areas. These include the NIH-supported Knowledge Network eﬀorts, the NIJ’s projects focusing on nonfatal ﬁrearm injuries and mining criminal justice insights from sources like the National Archive of Criminal Justice Data (NACJD). We are also keen to collaborate with NOAA’s environmental data projects related to climate and the Blue Economy, and with the USGS’s eﬀorts around topographic data integration and adherence to FAIR principles. Furthermore, we look forward to potential collaborations with the Department of Transportation on Transportation Equity, as well as projects that focus on Climate Change, Disaster Management, and Energy Systems. Lastly, we value the importance of accurate Health Communications and are excited about potential partnerships in this area. We believe these collaborations will allow us to build a richer, more comprehensive knowledge graph, which can better serve our collective goals and the communities we aim to support. Drawing on the resources provided by the AI center currently in development, we are planning to facilitate interdisciplinary meetings to tackle project challenges, brainstorm solutions, and identify potential avenues for collaboration. We are also eager to partake in joint research initiatives that resonate with the goals of several projects, with the objective of sharing resources, broadening our expertise base, and contributing to high-impact publications. We Figure 10: Collaboration diagram with other enthusiastically look forward to contributing to themes. the development and usage of collaborative tools and platforms. This includes cloud-based platforms that allow for eﬃcient data storage, sharing, and querying, project management tools, and collaborative software, like LLM for the purpose of querying knowledge graphs. Moreover, we plan to co-author policy briefs, utilizing insights from multiple projects. We believe this powerful approach will help shape policy-making related to public health, justice, and environmental sectors among others. Finally, in alignment with Theme 3, we are committed to spearheading public engagement activities, such as community forums, public lectures, and educational events. We trust that these activities will amplify our project’s visibility, stimulate public awareness and support, and provide channels for community participation and engagement. 4. Deliverables And Management Plan Definitions of the alpha and beta level deliverables The alpha-level deliverables serve as an initial preview of the envisioned final product for our stakeholders. They encompass elements such as a detailed project roadmap, data models and schemas, an assessment of data quality, a plan for data integration, a prototype of a knowledge graph sample, a preliminary query interface, initial project documentation, mechanisms for user feedback, along with protocols for governance and security. Progressing from the alpha stage, the beta-level deliverables exhibit a more sophisticated and refined version of the project. They encompass the final versions of the data models and schemas, an established mapping of entities with other Knowledge Graph (KG) projects, an advanced query interface, the capability to integrate with external systems, feedback from user testing, finely-tuned governance and security protocols, and established performance metrics. The ultimate deployment of the proposed knowledge graphs is set to undergo iterative evaluation, as detailed in Section 5. Figure 11: Project Timeline. Project Timeline Figure 11 depicts the project’s timeline, encompassing three key components: 1) Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) to facilitate engagement with end users, foster community partnerships, and incorporate social and cultural feedback. 2) The development of the Knowledge Graph (KG), which entails stages like data access, curation, quality assessment, transfer and generative learning, as well as the creation and refinement of user interfaces. 3) The creation and deployment of deliverables, which places emphasis on conducting standing meetings and workshops involving data providers, end users, and other relevant stakeholders. Anticipating potential challenges within this timeline, we identify two primary areas of concern: 1) The establishment of protocols for Institutional Review Board (IRB), data access and governance, and security could exceed our estimated timeframe. Nevertheless, we plan to draw from our prior experiences, as demonstrated in our preliminary work [22], to navigate potential obstacles. 2) The recruitment of local community participants may require more time than anticipated. In response to this, we intend to collaborate closely with community health and social workers, as well as Alabama State Senator, to establish broader connections. By identifying these potential challenges in advance, we aim to develop eﬀective strategies to ensure the project’s timely progression.
