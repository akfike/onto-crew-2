 the anticipated knowledge graph, focusing on rural communities impacted by the substance abuse crisis [26], along with health, justice aspects, and services concerning substance abuse. To ensure seamless integration with existing knowledge graphs, particularly the NSF-funded KnowWhereGraph, we will utilize the identical grid system known as the ”S2 Grid System” or Discrete Global Grid [27], for the portrayal of spatial regions. This system applies a hierarchical grid to the earth’s surface, where each grid cell at one level consists of four subordinate cells at a higher spatial resolution. In comparison to the KnowWhereGraph, our data will be served at a slightly superior resolution, specifically at least at the S2 level 16 (roughly 1200 square meters per cell) for the United States. The rationale behind this approach is our necessity to gather more detailed information on the socioeconomic, health, and justice circumstances of communities and their residents, including aspects like housing and transportation [22]. Employing the S2 grid system, we will create a design pattern that simplifies the process of understanding how features and regions could interact across the hierarchy. Furthermore, we plan to implement several open standards, including the WHO’s Conceptual Framework for Action on the Social Determinants of Health, the CDC’s Social Vulnerability Index (SVI), the NIMHD Minority Health and Health Disparities Research Framework, and the US Department of Justice’s (DOJ) National Information Exchange Model. 1.2 Social Aspects Of The Proposed Research The project will establish a new instance within the scope of community-based participatory research (CBPR) to engage a broad range of partners and end-users. It will actively engage with aware and aﬀected communities to ensure the inclusivity of data, users, and involved communities. Moreover, the CBPR will work with these communities to protect individuals’ privacy, civil rights, and liberties [21, 28], thus facilitating the creation of an ethically sound and responsible Proto-OKN. As illustrated in Figure 3, compared to other CBPR instances, our proposed CBPR leverage the knowledge graphs and the computational agents to support social-economic research. The initial phase of the CBPR involves identifying regional populations that haven’t yet been reached by community-based eﬀorts. Following this, we plan to gather insights and viewpoints from community members, utilizing methods like in-depth interviews, focus group discussions, and online surveys. The amalgamation of the knowledge graph and CBPR will take place during the data collection and analysis stage, prioritizing health and justice facets such as housing, population density, availability of insurance, and healthcare accessibility. For data collection and curation in the CBPR process, we’ll employ a mixed-method approach that encompasses recognized methods in socio-economic research, such as statistical testing [29], the general linear model [30], and factor analysis [31], along with machine learning techniques like classification, clustering, and time-series simulation. Furthermore, we’ll develop a blend of informal and formal strategies. The informal approach will oﬀer a short-term response to community changes in a ﬂexi-ble manner, whereas the formal strategies are meant to guarantee the sustainability and scalability of our outreach eﬀorts.
