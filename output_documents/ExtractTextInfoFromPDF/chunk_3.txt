, and the healthcare system. As part of the project’s scope, the query design will be specifically tailored to the individual, interpersonal, and community levels of in-fluence, aligning with the interests and needs of the end users. This focus ensures that the queries generate valuable insights regarding individuals, their interactions, and the broader community. In the context of vaccine hesitancy, the national alliance of social workers seeks to optimize the allocation of mobile healthcare units to under-served communities [56]. To make well-informed decisions, leveraging the knowledge graph and querying it for individual-level information on vaccine hesitancy in targeted re-Figure 7: Our previous work integrated CDC’s gions becomes invaluable.

As a result, the speciﬁc needs of communities are addressed, leading to enhanced access to vaccinations. Our previous work [22], depicted in Figure 7, showcases the development of individual-level information on vaccine hesitancy across the Alabama Black Belt, further emphasizing our commitment to tackling this issue. Another exampleissubstanceabuse, whichismoreprevalent in ruralareas with lowersocioeconomicstatus, such as Alabama [47]. To promote public education and training on substance abuse, a telehealth program with incentives may be implemented. For the success of such a program, community-level knowledge graph insights are essential. This would include critical ontologies related to health literacy, access to health infrastructure, social and cultural inﬂuences, and the corresponding social and religious networks [47]. The knowledge graph would provide a comprehensive understanding of these factors, empowering the development of targeted interventions and support systems for the aﬀected communities. User Interfaces and User-centered Design. Designing a user interface for a knowledge graph database that incorporates various geographic scales and data domains necessitates careful attention to data visualization, search capabilities, and user interactions. Our approach involves leveraging maps and geographic visualizations to depict the levels of influence, as outlined in the NIMHD research framework. The interface will be interactive, allowing users to explore different regions and delve into speciﬁc levels and areas of interest. Alongside the geographic data, we will utilize charts, graphs, and infographics to showcase the relationships between entities such as socioeconomics, health, and justice data. To enable eﬃcient searching, we will implement search functionalities using the Simple Protocol and RDF Query Language (SPARQL) as well as harness the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). We will ﬁne-tune the LLM to support natural language capabilities in search, empowering users with intuitive query abilities. Additionally, we will provide tailored guidance to enhance users’ proﬁciency in utilizing advanced search ﬁlters. In the pursuit of enhancing creativity and user acceptance, we will employ generative AI tools to design the user interface. This will facilitate the generation of innovative interface components and layouts. Figure 8 showcases an example of a generatively designed web-based interface for the proposed knowledge graph database. To ensure a user-centered approach, we will adopt participatory design practices throughout the project, actively involving end users in the design process of the user interfaces. Their insights and feedback will be invaluable in refining the interface design and overall user experience. As outlined in Section 5, the Evaluation Plan, we will conduct a user-centered design and usability test to comprehensively assess the usability of the web-based database service. This Figure 8: An example of a design process will involve recruiting participants representative of web-based interface for the the target user group and evaluating specific usability aspects, such proposed knowledge graph. as ease of use, navigation, data entry, and search functionality. By incorporating end users’ perspectives and conducting usability tests, we aim to create a highly usable and intuitive web-based database service. Data Synthesis and Computational Agents via Transfer and Generative Learning. Our previous work focused on vaccine hesitancy and highlighted the challenges we encountered when attempting to collect and integrate health and justice data in rural areas. These challenges arise due to factors such as lower population density, limited resources, and diﬃculties in data collection. As a result, the availability of data is severely limited, leading to data sparsity. This sparsity poses a signiﬁcant hurdle in developing accurate and robust knowledge graphs that rely on large and diverse datasets. In order to overcome the challenges posed by data sparsity in rural areas, the implementation of data synthesis eﬀorts using transfer learning and generative learning techniques becomes crucial. Transfer learning facilitates the utilization of knowledge and patterns acquired from one domain or dataset to enhance performance in another domain or with limited data [57]. By trans-Figure 9: Our preliminary work in transfer learning for CoVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in Alabama. ferring knowledge from well-resourced or related areas, models can leverage pre-existing information and adapt to the specific characteristics of rural data. Additionally, generative learning techniques [13] such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) [58] or variational autoencoders (VAEs) can be employed. These methodologies facilitate the production of synthetic data that closely mimic the traits and patterns of actual rural data across varying levels of inﬂuence, from the individual to the community [59, 60]. They also provide the capability to introduce behavioral agents, which could be utilized in simulated studies focused on Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) interventions [60–62]. By generating synthetic data, it becomes possible to increase the overall dataset size, thereby enabling more reliable model training and evaluation processes. Through the integration of transfer learning and generative techniques, we can mitigate the impact of data sparsity and enhance the eﬀectiveness of knowledge graph development in rural areas. Figure 9 illustrates our previous implementation of transfer learning to infer individual-level information regarding vaccine hesitancy across the state of Alabama. Enhancing Query Interfaces for Rural End Users using LLMs. Integrating knowledge graphs and LLMs poses significant challenges within the scientific community [63, 64]. Thus, this project will primarily focus on exploring querying methods that leverage the emerging capabilities of LLMs in natural language processing [65, 66]. Notably, the project will specifically address the unique context of rural areas in the United States, particularly the underrepresented communities, such as the Alabama Black Belt region. This region predominantly comprises residents of color, accounting for 80% of the population. Their cultural and social factors have been largely overlooked in the development of LLMs [67, 68]. Additionally, considering their lower public health literacy and education levels and socioeconomic status, it is essential to incorporate natural language interactions that align with their social and cultural languages. This project aims to bridge this gap and facilitate meaningful interactions between underrepresented communities and the knowledge graph. To collect valuable input from the community, including health workers, social workers, religious leaders, and social network influencers, we will employ the CBPR process described earlier. This approach will enable us to gather their questions, queries, and concerns. Subsequently, we will preprocess this data to ensure compatibility with large language models (LLMs). The preprocessing step will involve encoding entities, relationships, and attributes into embeddings or other representations that the language model can comprehend. Following the preprocessing stage, we will proceed to fine-tune the large language model using the curated data. This process will entail training the model on a combination of general language understanding tasks and specific tasks that utilize the knowledge graph, such as entity linking, relation extraction, or question answering. Theultimateobjectiveofthisstepistodevelop an interfacethatempowersend usersto interact and query the knowledge graph database using natural languages, even in the presence of cultural and social constraints. By incorporating the insights, questions, and concerns of the community participants and fine-tuning the language model accordingly, we aim to create a user-friendly interface that accommodates diverse linguistic and sociocultural contexts. 2. Partnerships And Engagement This project has eﬀectively identiﬁed and engaged a diverse range of stakeholders spanning government, industry, academia, non-proﬁts, and citizen service groups. This comprehensive network encompasses major organizations such as the Alabama Department of Public Health, Oﬃce of EMS, the National Association of Social Workers-Alabama Chapter, and the National Alliance on Mental Illness-Alabama Chapter. We have also secured the backing of Alabama State Senator Mr. Bobby Singleton, the representative for District 24, a crucial part of the Alabama Black Belt region. Fur-ther, our engagement strategy prominently features the active involvement of citizen service groups. A key example of this is the Alabama Health & Wellness Education Center, which provides vital services across numerous counties within the Alabama Black Belt area. In the ongoing journey of this project, we remain committed to expanding our network of participating constituents and intend to capitalize on the recent eﬀorts made by the University of Alabama. We will continue to explore new opportunities for collaboration to ensure a holistic and inclusive approach. Uniqueness of this Project and Community Engagement Under the expert guidance of Principal Investigators (PIs) Gong, Lee, and Geyer, this project emerges as one of the first initiatives designed to develop a database primed for artificial intelligence (AI) applications for Rural Resilience within Alabama State. Their collaborative work is directed towards leveraging AI technology to enhance data analysis and decision-making capabilities for the betterment of Alabama. PI Gong’s progressive research vision has been particularly noteworthy. Recognizing the immense potential and transformative power of his work, benefactors recently granted him a generous donation of $2 million from a local resident. These funds will be dedicated towards the establishment of an Artificial Intelligence Center led by the University of Alabama. The center promises to become a hub of innovation
