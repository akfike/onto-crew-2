Summary: The National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) is a major annual survey that collects data on the use of alcohol, tobacco, illicit drugs, and health issues related to substance use in the U.S. civilian, non-institutionalized population aged 12 and older. It is conducted by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

Purpose: The main purpose of NSDUH is to gather data that assists in public health and policy decision-making aimed at reducing substance abuse and promoting mental health. The survey's objectives include estimating substance use trends, assessing risks associated with substance use and mental health disorders, evaluating the effectiveness of treatment programs, and supporting related research.

Primary concepts: Key concepts in the NSDU were identified as prevalence, which is the number of cases of substance use in the population at a given time; incidence, which measures the number of new cases within a specified period; correlates of drug use, which are factors linked with increased or decreased risk of substance use; and substance use disorders, which are medical conditions characterized by uncontrollable substance use despite adverse consequences.
