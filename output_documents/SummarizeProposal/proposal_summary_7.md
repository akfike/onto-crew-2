The research project in question is dedicated to the development of a 'Cross-Domain Knowledge Graph' specifically designed to boost the resilience of rural communities in the face of public health and environmental crises. This initiative, which is a key component of the Proto-OKN Theme 1, strategically focuses on the integration of health and justice data. This integration is vital considering the heightened vulnerability of rural areas during global emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which have further emphasized the importance of these regions in sustaining fundamental resources like air quality, water supplies, food production, and supply chains.

The primary scope of this project is to construct an expansive, interdisciplinary knowledge graph that synthesizes diverse datasets encompassing health outcomes, climate changes, and social determinants impacting health and justice within rural settings. The design of this knowledge graph aims to serve as a powerful instrument for various stakeholders including researchers, practitioners, and educators, by enhancing their understanding of the risk landscapes prevalent in rural communities and strengthening their capabilities to foster resilience.

Operationally, the project is set to dovetail with existing initiatives such as the NSF-funded KnowWhereGraph, which would amplify its scientific utility in studying and fortifying rural resilience against crises. The intellectual contributions of this endeavor are particularly significant in advancing data management and analysis. This is achieved through the creation of a multidisciplinary knowledge graph that incorporates human, social, and organizational factors, and through developing innovative methods to address challenges like data heterogeneity, sparsity, and privacy concerns.

From a broader impact perspective, the envisioned knowledge graph is intended to act as a strategic guide for effective resource distribution, policy formulation, and the establishment of essential partnerships within rural communities. Outreach strategies are planned to engage a wide range of stakeholders, aiming to extensively disseminate the knowledge products and contribute to the interdisciplinary educational research community.

Moreover, the project encompasses a comprehensive suite of methodologies, computational models, design frameworks, software artifacts, and empirical data. These components are meticulously integrated to enrich knowledge across various domains including computer and information science, and social and behavioral sciences, thereby facilitating a cross-pollination of ideas and innovations that transcend traditional disciplinary boundaries. Through these concerted efforts, the project aspires to create a robust framework that not only addresses immediate resilience needs but also contributes to the sustainable development of rural areas in the long term.
