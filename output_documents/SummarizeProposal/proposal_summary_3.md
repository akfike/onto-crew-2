The domain of the research project focuses on the development of a comprehensive "Cross-Domain Knowledge Graph" aimed at enhancing the resilience of rural communities to public health and environmental crises. This initiative, part of the Proto-OKN Theme 1, emphasizes the integration of health and justice data to fortify rural resilience, a need underscored by challenges such as the COVID-19 pandemic. These challenges highlight the critical role of rural areas in maintaining essential resources such as air quality, water supplies, food production, and supply chains.

The project's scope involves creating an extensive, interdisciplinary knowledge graph that amalgamates previously isolated datasets related to health outcomes, climate changes, and social determinants of health and justice within rural areas. This graph is designed to function as a robust tool for researchers, practitioners, and educators, enhancing their capacity to understand the risk environments in rural areas and to bolster their resilience effectively.

Operationally, the project aims to align with existing geo-enrichment services and initiatives, notably the NSF-funded KnowWhereGraph, to enhance scientific studies concerning rural resilience to crises. The intellectual contributions of this project include the advancement of data management and analysis through the development of a multidisciplinary knowledge graph that considers human, social, and organizational factors, and the formulation of data amalgamation methods to tackle issues such as data heterogeneity, sparsity, and privacy.

From a broader impact perspective, the knowledge graph is envisioned as a navigational aid for effective resource allocation, policy development, and establishment of partnerships within rural communities. Outreach efforts are directed towards a diverse array of stakeholders, with goals to broadly disseminate knowledge products and contribute to the interdisciplinary educational research community. Additionally, the project includes an extensive array of methodologies, computational models, design frameworks, software artifacts, and empirical data, which collectively serve to enrich knowledge across fields such as computer and information science, social and behavioral sciences, and beyond.
