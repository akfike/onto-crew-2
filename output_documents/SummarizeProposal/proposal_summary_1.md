The research project described in the snippet revolves around the creation of a "Cross-Domain Knowledge Graph" to enhance the resilience of rural communities to public health and environmental crises. This initiative is a part of the Proto-OKN Theme 1, which is focused on integrating health and justice data for rural resilience. The pressing need for such a project has been underscored by the challenges highlighted during the COVID-19 pandemic, emphasizing the importance of rural areas in preserving essential resources like air quality, water supplies, food production, and supply chains. 

The core strategy involves the construction of an extensive, interdisciplinary knowledge graph that merges and interconnects previously separate datasets related to health outcomes, climate changes, and social determinants of health and justice within rural locales. This graph is intended to serve as a powerful tool for researchers, practitioners, and educators, enhancing their ability to understand risk environments in rural areas and strengthen their resilience. 

The project aims to synchronize efforts with existing geo-enrichment services and initiatives such as the NSF-funded KnowWhereGraph, among others, to boost scientific studies of rural resilience to crises. Intellectual contributions of the project include advancing data management and analysis through the creation of a multidisciplinary knowledge graph that considers human, social, and organizational factors, and developing data amalgamation methods to address challenges like data heterogeneity, sparsity, and privacy. 

In terms of broader impacts, the knowledge graph will act as a navigational tool for effective resource allocation, policy development, and partnership establishment within rural communities. Outreach initiatives will target a diverse group of stakeholders, aiming to disseminate knowledge products widely and contribute to the interdisciplinary educational research community. The project also encompasses a robust collection of methodologies, computational models, design frameworks, software artifacts, and empirical data, making it a rich resource for advancing knowledge in computer and information science, social and behavioral sciences, and beyond.
